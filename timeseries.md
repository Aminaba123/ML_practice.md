In time series analysis, making a series stationary means transforming it in such a way that its statistical properties, such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, do not change over time. A stationary time series is easier to model and analyze, particularly for methods like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average).

Why should make the series in stayionary ?

Statistical Properties: Many statistical methods and models assume that the underlying data is stationary. Non-stationary data can lead to unreliable and spurious results.

Prediction Accuracy: Stationary data often leads to better predictions because the underlying patterns become clearer without the noise of trends or seasonality.

Modeling: Time series models like ARIMA require stationary data for accurate parameter estimation and forecasting.

One solution is :

Taking the difference of the data refers to a technique used to achieve stationarity. Specifically, it involves subtracting the previous observation from the current observation. This process helps to eliminate trends and seasonality in the data.
