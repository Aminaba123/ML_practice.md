### K-Means 

Is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that clusters data into a specified number of groups (K) by minimizing the `within-cluster sum-of-squares (WCSS)`, also known as `inertia`. The algorithm iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest `centroid`, then updates the centroids by calculating the mean of all assigned points. The process repeats until convergence or a stopping criterion is reached.
