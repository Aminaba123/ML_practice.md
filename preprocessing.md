Normalization, also known as Min-Max scaling, transforms the data linearly to a specified range, typically between 0 and 1. It accomplishes this by subtracting the feature's minimum value and then dividing by the range (max - min). Mathematically, for a feature vector X, normalization transforms it as follows:
